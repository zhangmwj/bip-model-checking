/**
 * ASEBA backend for BIP compiler.
 * 
 * This Backend makes strong asumptions on the input language (a subset of the
 * BIP language). It also heavily relies on the Send/Receive BIP constructs.
 * 
 * A set of annotations and naming conventions must be used in order for 
 * the backend to work:
 *  - variables with double '_' are mapped to dotted notation, '__' being replaced by a single dot.
 *    This is because aseba can use dotted notation but not BIP.
 *  - a variable with the 'system' aseba annotation denotes a variable that must
 *    not be declared in aseba as it's a builtin variable: '@aseba(system)'
 *  - a variable with the 'system' annotation and the 'map=FOO' will skip data
 *    declaration (system) and also rename reference to the variable to its corresponding
 *    value 'FOO' given in the annotation.
 *  - an exported port with the 'recv' annotation will be treated as a port by which
 *    something is received (data or simply an event).
 *  - an exported port with the 'send' annotation will be treated as a port by which
 *    something is sent (data or simply an event).
 *  - a component declaration must have a 'node="ASEBA NODE NAME"' annotation to guide the
 *    distribution of the generated code across available nodes.
 *  - a single component declaration may have the 'booter' annotation. It is used
 *    in case of delayed init, where all nodes are awaiting a 'start' event that the
 *    booter component will emit after a small delay (if --genaesl-start-delay is used).
 *  
 * This backend is responsible for generating ASEBA code from a BIP model.
 * It targets the Marxbot specifically by could be adapted to any platform
 * supporting ASEBA.
