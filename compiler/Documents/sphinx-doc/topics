BIP language:
- syntax
- semantic

Tutorial for BIP modeling:
- bottom/up or top/down ? ;)
- principles (how to "think" before starting coding?)
- explain with a "running" (across different sections) example that is enriched step by step

Tools:
- what is the compiler
- what is an engine
- how do they interact ? : the compiler generates code suitable for the engine

Tools internals (dev doc only):
- modules
- interface btw frontend/middleend/backend
- how to load backends
- EMF meta model : 
 - type vs instance models
 - what files ?
 - how to modify it:
  - change model
  - constraints
  - generating java code with care (keep hand modification, commit correctly)

Using the compiler
- requirements
- download & install
 - quick tour of installation (files, directories, ...)
- using the frontend to check for correctness
 - works for type model & instance model
- using a backend to generate something
 - general principles
 - C++ 
 - Aseba (experimental)
 - BIP

Using the ref engine:
- presentation
- need to generate C++ code from reference backend
- download & install
 - quick tour (generic, specific, hpp/cpp)
- compile & link engine w/ generated code
